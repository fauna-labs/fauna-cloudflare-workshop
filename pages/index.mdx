# Build Globally Distributed Apps with Fauna and Cloudflare

This self-paced workshop demonstrates how to build a Next.js application
using Fauna and Cloudflare. You will build a video-sharing application similar
to Loom or Dropbox Capture. The application is deployed in multiple geographic
regions making it a globally distributed application. To create the
application, this workshop guides you through the following activities:

- Build and deploy a Next.js application with Cloudflare Pages.
- Demonstrate Fauna's globally distributed database capabilities.
- Deploy serverless backend code with Cloudflare Workers across the globe to give it exceptional performance, reliability, and scale.
- Use Fauna's built-in authentication and user-defined functions to sign up
  users to the app.
- Ensure users only see permitted data with Fauna's ABAC feature.

Finally, you'll learn some best practices to deploy and improve full-stack,
serverless edge applications.

## About the workshop code

This workshop is written in Javascript and relies on the **Next.js** and
**React** frameworks. It uses the Fauna v10 query language. To complete the
tutorial, you need some experience programming but not specific experience with
these tools.

This workshop was written and tested using the Chrome browser version
115.0.5790.114 (Official Build) (x86_64) running in macOS Ventura version
13.5.1. The content reflects this environment. If you are running in another,
you may need to adjust for your command line environment.

You can [try the application](https://video-sharing.pages.dev/) before you
build it. You can get the complete code for this project [here](https://github.com/fauna-labs/video-sharing).
