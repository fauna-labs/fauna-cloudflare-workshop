# Set up the Project

In this section you create the initial Next.js project directory, configure a
Fauna database, and connect your application to the database. Before you begin
make sure you have installed the [Node Package
Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (npm) in your local machine
environment. Also, the procedures on this page assume you have already [created
a Fauna dashboard account](https://dashboard.fauna.com/login).


## Initialize the project.

Open a terminal in your local environment and do the following:

1. Set up a new Next.js project.

    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest
    ```

    This launches an interactive project builder.

2. Name your project `video-sharing` or something similar.


    ```jsx
    ✔ What is your project named? … video-sharing
    ```

3. Choose the following options:

    ```jsx
    ✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No
    ✔ Would you like to use ESLint? …  Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No
    ✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … Yes
    ✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? … No
    Creating a new Next.js app in /Users/ma/test/video-sharing.

    Using npm.
    ...

    Success! Created video-sharing at /Users/ma/test/video-sharing

    ```

    This workshop uses the new Next.js 13 folder structures and app router. It
    also sticks with JavaScript for simplicity.

3. Change directory in your `video-sharing` project directory.

    ```bash
    cd video-sharing/
    ```

3. Install the `fauna` npm package by running the following command in your terminal.

    ```bash
    npm i fauna --save
    ```

4. Verify you have completed the setup correctly by starting the Next.js template app.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This should start a server running at `http://localhost:3000` in your
    environment.

   If for some reason the server does not start, retrace and make sure you
   followed this procedure accurately. If you still have problems, please ask
   for help on the [Fauna Community](https://fauna.com/community).

6. Use `CTRL-C` in your terminal to stop the server process you started.

## Create a Fauna database

In this procedure, you create a new Fauna database.

1. Login into the [dashboard.fauna.com](http://dashboard.fauna.com).
2. Select **CREATE DATABASE**.

    ![Create
    database](https://workshop-shadid.s3.amazonaws.com/cffqlx/1-getting-started-create-database.png)

3. Complete the dialog:

    - Give your database a name.
    - Select a region group for your database.

        If you select the US, Fauna creates a database with 3 replicas across
        the US. Fauna ensures that the data is always served from the user's
        nearest location for reduced latency. For instance, if a user's
        location is Iowa, Fauna retrieves and serves the data from the center.
        closest replica, which is in Ohio. If a user is in California, Fauna
        serves data from the California data

    - Leave **Backups** disabled for backups.

4. Press **CREATE**.

    ![Create
        database](https://workshop-shadid.s3.amazonaws.com/cffqlx/2-getting-started-create-database.png)

5. Open you database by selecting it from the dashboard.

    The system displays the database *Explorer* and shell.

6. Look for the **CREATE COLLECTION** button in the lower left panel.

    You can also create a collection by entering queries in the dashboard
    shell.

7. Create three collections named `User`, `Video` and `Permission`.

   The application relies on these collection names, so do not change them.
       ![Create
      collections](https://workshop-shadid.s3.amazonaws.com/cffqlx/4-getting-started-create-collections.png)

   You can also create a collection by entering this query in the Fauna
       shell.

        ```bash
        Collection.create({ name: "Video" })
        ```
    When you are done, you should see the three collections in the lower left,
      panel of the **Explorer**.

8.  Create a key you can use to connect the application to your database by
       entering the following in the Fauna web shell:

     ```jsx
    Key.create({role: "server"})
    ```

        ![Getting secret
      key](https://workshop-shadid.s3.amazonaws.com/cffqlx/5-getting-started-get-key.png)

        **NOTE**: At creation is the only time Fauna displays the `secret`
      field. The value in this field is equivalent to a password. Fauna cannot
      recover a secret that is discarded or lost.

9.  Copy and save the generated secret to a safe place.

## Connect the Project to Fauna

In a terminal window in your local environment, change into your
application project directory. Then, do the following:

1. Create a .env file in the root of your project.

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
1. Open the file and create an environment variable for the key secret you created in your database.

      ```
      // .env
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FAUNA_KEY="your-key-here"
      ```
1. Save and close the `.env` file.

1. Open the `src/app/page.js` file for editing.

1. Replace the contents of the file with the following:

    ```jsx
    'use client'
    import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
    import { Client, fql } from "fauna";

    export default function Home() {

      const client = new Client({
        secret: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FAUNA_KEY
      });

      useEffect(() => {
        client.query(fql`
          User.all()
        `).then((response) => {
          console.log('response', response.data.data)
        })
      }, []);

      return (
        <>
          <div>
            Hello World
          </div>
        </>

      );
    }
    ```

    [code](https://github.com/fauna-labs/video-sharing/blob/aee8cdd4d7d0f1da990213c7ce84860f041af6da/src/app/page.js)*

    This code replaces the Next.js template content with a simple hello world.
    It also adds a query to list the contents of the `User` collection you
    created in your database.

1. Save and close the `src/app/page.js` file.

1. Start the app to see your changes.
    ```bash

    npm run dev
    ```

    This should start a server running at `http://localhost:3000` in your
    environment.

1. Verify you see the `Hello World` text in place of the Next.js template text.

1. Start the [Chrome Developer
   Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/) in your browser
   and bring up the **Console**.

   You find an empty query `response` in the log. This happens because the
   `User` collection is empty at this point.
