# Application Architecture

The Fauna and Cloudflare technology stack is well suited for quickly building
scalable applications. Using this stack you can:

- Take advantage of serverless computing to build and scale applications fast.
- Deliver a low-latency user experience to customers across different global locations.
- Decrease time spent scaling and managing application and database servers.
- Increase the time and resources you use to deliver application features.


## Why Fauna

Fauna is a distributed relational database with a document data model delivered
as a cloud API. It offers advanced querying capabilities, robust consistency
guarantees, and comprehensive support for data operations. Fauna automatically
replicates your data in multiple locations worldwide. Fauna uses [intelligent
request routing](https://fauna.com/blog/global-applications), which fetches or
writes data to the nearest replica without developers having to specify which
replica to use.

When a user interacts with a Fauna-backed application, intelligent routing
ensures that user data is fetched from the geographic copy nearest to the user.
The result is less time to retrieve or send data and an improved user
experience.

## Why Cloudflare

Cloudflare [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) and [Pages
Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/) by
default are invoked in a data center closest to where the request was received.

If you are running back-end logic in a Worker, it may be more performant to run
that Worker closer to your back-end infrastructure rather than the end user.
Cloudflare's **[Smart
Placement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/smart-placement/)**
feature automatically places your workloads in an optimal location that
minimizes latency and speeds up your applications. You may benefit from Smart
Placement if you are making multiple round trips to a centralized database, API
or origin server in a Worker.

Cloudflare R2 Storage stores your unstructured data (blob) nearest to your
customers, reducing latency. There are no egress fees in R2, which can unlock
some very neat use cases.

## The Application Flow

The video share application you will build has these functions:

- User signup.
- User login.
- Record videos with multiple settings.
- Share videos with other users.
- View videos created or shared.

The following is the architecture flow for saving a new video in the
application.

![application-architecture](https://workshop-shadid.s3.amazonaws.com/cffqlx/application-architecture.png)

1. A user creates an account and authenticates.
2. The user records a new video.
3. The application stores its data in the Fauna database:
    - the video metadata such as date, length, and so forth.
    - the creator or owner of the video
    - a list of users granted access to view the video

4. Fauna storage generates a video `id` and a Cloudflare worker function saves
   `id` with the video blob to R2 storage.

5. When a user later wants to view their video or one shared with them, an API call to Cloudflare’s workers retrieves the corresponding
    video from storage.
