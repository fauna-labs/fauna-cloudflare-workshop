# Set up Cloudflare Storage

In this section, you use your [Cloudflare
account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) to set up a Cloudflare R2 storage
bucket. This bucket will hold the videos added by the applications users.

## Create the Cloudflare Storage

1. Log into the [CloudFlare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
1. Select the **R2** option.

	![Create bucket](https://workshop-shadid.s3.amazonaws.com/cffqlx/2-implementing-video-recording-create-bucket.png)

1. Click the **Create Bucket** button.

   The system displays the **Create a bucket** dialog.

2. Name your bucket `videostore` and click **Create bucket**.

## Configure a Cloudflare Worker

The application uses a Cloudflare worker function to upload/download files from
R2. Open a terminal on your local machine and do the following:

1. Change directory to the root of your project.
1. Launch interactive command to add a Cloudflare worker backend.

	```bash
	npm create cloudflare@latest
	```

3. Select the following options from the command:

		```bash
		Create an application with Cloudflare Step 1 of 3
		│
		├ In which directory do you want to create your application?
		│ dir ./backend
		│
		├ What type of application do you want to create?

		│ ...
		```

1. Change into the `backend` directory.

1. Run the worker function **locally** to verify it is working as expected.

	```bash
	npm run start

	> backend@0.0.0 start
	> wrangler dev

	⛅️ wrangler 3.7.0
	------------------
	wrangler dev now uses local mode by default, powered by 🔥 Miniflare and 👷 workerd.
	To run an edge preview session for your Worker, use wrangler dev --remote
	⎔ Starting local server...
	[mf:inf] Ready on http://0.0.0.0:8787
    [mf:inf] - http://10.0.0.36:8787
	[mf:inf] GET / 200 OK (5ms)
	[mf:inf] GET /favicon.ico 200 OK (0ms)
	```
1.  Open a browser to visit [http://0.0.0.0:8787](http://0.0.0.0:8787) and
    verify that you get a “hello world” message.

1. Press `x` to stop the server.

## Configure the Bucket Backend

1. In your project, open the `backend/wrangler.toml` file.
1. Locate the `# Bind an R2 Bucket` section.
1. Uncomment the lines and add your bucket information.

	```bash
	[[r2_buckets]]
	binding = "MY_BUCKET"
	bucket_name = "videostore"
	```

	The `binding` value should be a valid Javscript variable name, in this case
	`MY_BUCKET`. The `bucket_name` value should be the bucket name created in
	the previous procedure.

1. Save and close the `wrangler.toml` file.

1. Open the `backend/src/index.js` file and add the following code.

	```jsx
	// backend/src/index.js
	export default {
		async fetch(request, env) {
		const url = new URL(request.url);
		const key = url.pathname.slice(1);

		const corsHeaders = {
		'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
		'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS',
		'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': '*',
		};

		switch (request.method) {
				case 'PUT':
					await env.MY_BUCKET.put(key, request.body);
					return new Response(`Put ${key} successfully!`, {
						headers: corsHeaders,
					});
				case 'GET':
					const object = await env.MY_BUCKET.get(key);

					if (object === null) {
						return new Response('Object Not Found', { status: 404, headers: corsHeaders });
					}

					const headers = new Headers();
					object.writeHttpMetadata(headers);
					headers.set('etag', object.httpEtag);
					Object.assign(headers, corsHeaders);

					return new Response(object.body, {
						headers,
					});
				case 'DELETE':
					await env.MY_BUCKET.delete(key);
					return new Response('Deleted!', {
						headers: corsHeaders,
					});

				default:
					return new Response('Method Not Allowed', {
					status: 405,
					headers: {
						Allow: 'PUT, GET, DELETE',
						...corsHeaders,
					},
					});
				}
		},
	};
	```

👩🏻‍💻 *[link to code](https://github.com/fauna-labs/video-sharing/blob/4d87fddef72073291542b763f939e2a14e03f25c/backend/src/worker.js)*

In this code, the worker function handles different HTTP requests. When a `PUT`
request is made, the worker connects to the bucket and uploads the payload
file. A `GET` request retrieves a file from the bucket and `DELETE` request
deletes the file with a given name from the bucket.

## Deploy and Test the Worker

1. Change to the `backend` directory.

1. Run the following command to deploy the worker to Cloudflare.

	```bash
	npm run deploy
	```

   After a successful, deploy you will get a deployed URL something similar to the following.

	```bash
	 ⛅️ wrangler 3.7.0
	------------------
	Your worker has access to the following bindings:
	- R2 Buckets:
	- MY_BUCKET: videostore
	Total Upload: 1.38 KiB / gzip: 0.57 KiB
	Uploaded backend (0.97 sec)
	Published backend (0.24 sec)
	https://backend.maryvide.workers.dev
	Current Deployment ID: ea3fb914-f11d-41af-a581-d4066ab8acc2
	```

	Your deployment URL and ID will be different.

1. Save the URL and ID information in a location you can refer to later.

1. In the current directory, create a file you can test your work with.

	```bash
	date > test.txt
	```

1. Run the following CURL command to upload your `test.txt` file.

	 `curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @test.txt https://backend.maryvide.workers.dev/test.txt`


	Make sure to change the deployment URL to yours. If the command is
	successful, you should see the following message:

	`Put test.txt successfully!`

1. Open Cloudflare dashboard, you should see your `test.txt` upload in your bucket.
